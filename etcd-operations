# etcd operations

- search for etcd backups in docs
- /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt, server.crt, server.key
- to restore, use the etcdctl command, then update the etcd pod at /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml, this part. this will recreate the etcd pod, `crictl ps` to monitor status.

```

  volumes:
  - hostPath:
      path: /var/lib/etcd-from-backup # Newly restored backup directory
      type: DirectoryOrCreate
    name: etcd-data
